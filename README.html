<p>Is it just me, or is your hard drive also full of abandoned projects, ideas et cetera? I know I’m not alone.</p>
<p>Cleaning up my R folder the other day, I stumbled upon a file I hardly remember creating. It is was a Shiny app built to help one calculate the hourly rate of services, given a desired income and an amount of time working (billable hours in a day, days in a week, weeks in a year). I think I built it watching the RStudio intro webinars into Shiny: part 1, part 2 and part 3.</p>
<p>The idea is that the user inputs all the values, and then the app suggests how to change any of the values to bring the system to the equilibrium.</p>
<p>Now that I’ve found the file, I’m publishing it as is at <a href="https://taraskaduk.shinyapps.io/rate/" class="uri">https://taraskaduk.shinyapps.io/rate/</a>. Below is the app, the explanation and the code-through.</p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>
<p>I know, I know, good UI needs no explanation. Please pardon my poor design. Finessing the details is something I may work on later. Today, I’m living by “ship daily”, and so I ship my minimum viable product</p>
<p>So, it works like this. First, you enter your desired figures into the input box. Let’s say, you are guessing a $75/hr rate, and you’re hoping to have 6 billable hours a day, working 5 days a week, 48 weeks a year. You’re hoping to make $100,000 a year in gross income</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="/post/2018-01-shiny-rate/figures/1.png" style="width:100.0%" />

</div>
<p>Now looking at the output pane, the result is not too far from our initial estimate, but we’re slightly off, making only $108,000 instead of $120,000: <img src="/post/2018-01-shiny-rate/figures/2.png" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>How can we get to $120K? Well, the app suggests a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>we can bump up our rate to $83/hr</li>
<li>we can shoot for more than 6 hours billable hours a day (it still says 6, but that’s obviously rounding)</li>
<li>we could keep the billable hours and the rate the same, but work more days a week</li>
<li>we can leave all the parameters as they are, but increase the amount of weeks working from 48 to… 53. Bummer, a year only has 52 weeks, therefore this won’t work.</li>
<li>we could settle for less and keep the $108K</li>
<li>finally, we could find a compromise by changing every parameter slightly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Moving the needle on any of these parameters will “stabilize” the system. Watch:</p>
<p><img src="/post/2018-01-shiny-rate/figures/3.png" alt="Changing the rate from $75 to $84/hour" style="width:100.0%" /> <img src="/post/2018-01-shiny-rate/figures/3.png" alt="Changing the rate to $80/hour and working 50 weeks a year" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<p>That is pretty much it, in a nutshell. I was interested in making this kind dynamic calculation possible. It took me a while, but it works as expected.</p>

<h2>The code</h2>
<p>Here is a reminder for me: always annotate your code! When I dug it out last week, I could barely understand anything. I still don’t get a solid chunk of it.</p>
<p>I’m going to annotate it as much as I can, with the time I have. Hopefully you can comb through it.</p>
<p>Any improvements? Suggestions? It’s all on Github — you know what to do!</p>
